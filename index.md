- ## Techstart Portfolio

Here is all of my projects that i did from the program Techstart.
The program was made by Facebook.  I have been working on it and it is really fun.

### 1. **ChatBot**

I made a chat bot about EAST.  It tells what we did this year 
and what stuff we use in class.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ianlandrum/ianlandrum.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
